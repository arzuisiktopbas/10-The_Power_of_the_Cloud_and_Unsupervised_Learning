# Unit 13 Homework Assignment - The Power of the Cloud and Unsupervised Learning
*by Arzu Isik Topbas*

### Clustering Crypto

In this homework assignment, I put my unsupervivsed learning and Amazon SageMaker skills into action by clustering cryptocurrencies and creating plots to present the results.

You are asked to accomplish the following main tasks:

**1 - Data Preprocessing :** 

* I cleaned data for dimension reduction with PCA and clustering using K-Means.

**2 - Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA :** 

* I reduced data dimension using the `PCA` algorithm from `sklearn`.

**3 - Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-Means :** 

* I predicted clusters using the cryptocurrencies data using the `KMeans` algorithm from `sklearn`.

**4 - Visualizing Results :** 
* I created some plots and data tables to present your results.
